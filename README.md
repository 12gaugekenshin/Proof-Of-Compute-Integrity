Each Simulation is either running mulitple test's or just one. I tried to keep the name's kind-of similar with identifying ending abbreviations for said test but I was going very fast betwenn models so I can't recall all of them.

A lot of these are random security tests, long run tests, Byzantine tests, Random starting point / random good-bad proofs. 

 Some might require Pynacl.

 In order to run the simulation tests; put file in a location. Like desktop

 Run CMD, type CD Desktop 

 Once CMD is pointing to desktop ( or wherever you have the file) type python poci_demo(whatever version youre testing).py 

 Simulation will run and give results. Each time you run it; it will give different ending outputs such as overall trust etc. But the IDENTIFYING MATH always works.
