Each Simulation is either running mulitple test's or just one. I tried to keep the name's kind-of similar with identifying ending abbreviations for said test but I was going very fast betwenn models so I can't recall all of them.

A lot of these are random security tests, long run tests, Byzantine tests, Random starting point / random good-bad proofs.
